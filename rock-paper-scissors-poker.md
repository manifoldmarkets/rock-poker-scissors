## **Motivation**

No-limit hold ‘em is a great game but not beginner friendly or suitable for casual play at parties. Games can also drag on and on.

This is the pickleball to hold ‘em’s tennis. Simpler, faster-paced, and more social.

## Rules

- Same stages (2 card hole + flop, turn, river) and hand rankings as hold ‘em
- Antes instead of blinds
- Betting occurs in one simultaneous action after each stage:
    - Players chant “Rock - Paper - Scissors - Shoot!” and choose one of three actions:
        - Paper: check, fold
        - Scissors: check, call
        - Rock: raise, call
    - The raise amount is equal to half of the pot at the beginning of the stage, rounded down
    - Raises are additive
- All players that reach showdown must show their cards

## Example game

- Players A, B, C, D ante $1 each, forming a pot of $4
- The bet amount is $4/2 = $2 for pre-flop
- A, B, C, D shoot Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock (respectively). Since there are 2 rocks/raises, A, B, D each add $4 (= 2 x $2) to the pot and progress to the flop; B folds.
- Pot is now $16, bet is $8.
- After the flop, A, B, D shoot Rock, Paper, Scissors. A, D add $8 each to the pot. B folds.
- Pot is now $24, bet is $12.
- The turn: A, D shoot Rock, Paper. D folds. A wins the pot of $24.
